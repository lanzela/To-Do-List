# To-Do List Project

This is a simple web-based to-do list application that allows you to manage your tasks. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and includes the following functionalities:

1. **Add Tasks:**
   - You can add tasks to your to-do list by typing the task description in the input field and pressing the "Add" button or by pressing the "Enter" key on your keyboard.

2. **Mark Tasks as Completed:**
   - To mark a task as completed, simply click on the task. A checked mark will appear and the task will be visually crossed out to indicate that it is done.

3. **Delete Tasks:**
   - If you want to remove a task from the list, click the cross button next to the task. The task will be permanently removed from your to-do list.

4. **Data Persistence:**
   - Your to-do list data is saved in the browser's local storage. This means that even if you reload the page, close and reopen it, or come back later, your tasks will still be there.
